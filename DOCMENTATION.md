The game started off as a 2d platformer based on the book The Alchemist. 
As we began to work on it we decided that maybe this was not the idea for us, the 2d platformer switched to a 2d top down, and the level system Joss made gave us an idea learning towards a differnt story idea.
After little thinking we decided that our new story would be rapunzel, and you would climb a tower, fighting off enemies and collection tressure.
This decision was made with less than 2 weeks to go on the whole task, and at the time we had little to no code or art to acompany the game. 

Now between doing work in class, Joss coding and Samson art, and a little work at home, the due date rolled around and we both realised that we didnt quite have a game.
We had a pygame base working, (written by joss), a player class (written by joss), as enemy class (written by samsom), and npc or sheep class (written by samson and joss), a background loader and switcher (written by joss), and level system (written by joss), and some wall collisions (written by samson and joss). But this is not a game, and that really showed when we only had 1 coloured block walking into walls on the final day. 

After discussing between each other, we dicided to not submit the project, at 4:10 the day it was due, but hopefully later that night, and try work on it in the mean time. This also did not go to plan, and the fight/collition code that samson was working on never really came together, along with the lack of art and gameplay. At this point we decided to once again change our idea of the game, to the maze runner, another book. 

This new change allowed us to chnage up the levels, in theory making the game easier to do. But once again history would repeat itself and problems would arise with no time left to solve them. In its final state the game has 2 levels; and one of them doesnt work. Joss was going to make for, but after failing to solve the problem with the loading of the second one, there was no real point if you werent even going to be able to load them.

Along with the failed levels there was ideas of items, more npcs, art, and a final boss. Non of the came to be, mainly because of the lack of time managment, work dividing, and effort put in. Given 1-2 more weeks the game may have come together, but we dont have 1-2 more weeks, so this is the final product. 

while the game is probably the furthest possible thing from a good piece of work, we both thoughly enjoyed working, failing and problem solving the project. Better time managerment would have helped making this more enjoyable, but it is what it is and thats ok. 

Have a great time looking over and playing our *quaility* game, even if it is unfinished and submitted late.
